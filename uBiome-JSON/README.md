# Explore individual uBiome JSON raw files

Provides a quick overview of the top 20 bacterial taxonomies (by relative percentage)  from a raw uBiome JSON file.
The ranking is done for each bacterial taxonomic classification as per the uBiome web interface.

Bar charts are used to visualize the data (instead of pie/donut charts like in the uBiome web interface) to avoid overwhelming amounts of information.
Looking at just the top 20 taxonomic entities allows one to identify the most important entities from the sample, which can then be explored through google searches.
