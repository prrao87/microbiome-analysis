# Explore individual uBiome JSON raw files

Provides a quick overview of the top 20 bacterial taxonomies (by relative percentage)  from a raw uBiome JSON file.
The ranking is done for each bacterial taxonomic classification as per the uBiome web interface.

Instead of pie/donut charts like in the uBiome web interface, bar charts are used to visualize the data to avoid overwhelming amounts of information.
Looking at the top 20 taxonomic entities allows one to absorb the key pieces of information from the sample, which can then be explored through google searches for the dominant taxa.
